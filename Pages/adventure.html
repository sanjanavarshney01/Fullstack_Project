          survey nature's bounty laid out in splendour beneath you. Nandi Hills,

          more satisfying than skydiving. Tandem skydiving is a famed adventure
          sport across the world and there are two places in India where it can
          be enjoyed. The first one is the city of Deesa, in Gujarat, that was

          sheer thrill and romance of gliding smoothly over historical, elegant,
          and charming cities of India, it invites tourists to holiday at a
          slower pace. Jaipur, home to regal palaces and forts, offers tourists
          a chance to explore their opulent riches from the sky. This adventure

          city.
